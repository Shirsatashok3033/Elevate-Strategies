The increasing awareness about pet safety, comfort, and convenience in the region is driving demand for high-quality, sturdy, and versatile metal pet cages. Additionally, factors such as increasing urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and changing lifestyles are contributing to the growth of these segments.</p> <h3>Application I: Dog Cages</h3> <p>The demand for metal dog cages in the Asia Pacific region is substantial due to the growing number of dog owners. Metal dog cages are typically used for training, transportation, and providing a secure and safe environment for dogs.
