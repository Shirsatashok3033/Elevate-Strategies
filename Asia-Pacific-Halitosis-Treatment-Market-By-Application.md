Many clinics offer personalized diagnostic services, including breath analysis and bacterial culture testing, to determine the root causes of bad breath. Treatment options in clinics often include professional cleaning, the use of medicated mouthwashes, or treatments to address underlying issues such as gum disease or tooth decay.
